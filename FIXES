For Debian et al. compilation, run

sudo mozroots --import --machine --sync
sudo certmgr -ssl -m https://go.microsoft.com
sudo certmgr -ssl -m https://nugetgallery.blob.core.windows.net
sudo certmgr -ssl -m https://nuget.org

to fix "Error getting response stream (Write: The authentication or decryption has failed.): SendFailure"
whereby the NuGet package manager cannot download requisite extensions.


Delete support for WebHdfs etc from the solution because it depends on managed C++ which won't compile
(at least not easily) under Mono.
